            <p id="para">
            Lalbagh Fort is an incomplete structure by a Mughal prince and later emperor himself named Muhammad Azam (third son of Aurangazeb). He started the work of the fort in 1678 during his vice-royalty in Bengal. He stayed in Bengal for 15 months. It remained incomplete when he was called by his father Aurangazeb to the capital Delhi.
            Shaista Khan was the new Subedar (Governor) of Dhaka in that time, and he did not complete the fort. In 1684, the daughter of Shaista Khan named Iran Dukht (Pari Bibi) died there. After her death, he started thinking the fort as ominous and left the structure incomplete. Among the 3 major parts of Lalbagh Fort, one is the tomb of Pari Bibi.

            This mosque is situated in the western part of the complex, aligned with the tomb of Bibi Pari. The Lalbagh Fort mosque is a typical Bengali Mughal type – a rectangular structure crowned with three-domes. It is one of the finest examples of its kind, where the central dome is larger. The mosque is still in use and separated with a fence from the fort so that people can enter it for prayer without any ticket.

            <p id="para">
            Of the Mughal buildings inside the fort, Bibi Pari’s Mausoleum is the most important, as it is a unique structure. It is the only building where black basalt from Rajmahal Hills, white marble from Rajputana and encaustic tiles of various colors, have been used to decorate its interior.
            The 66′-0″ square monument stands in the center of a raised, stone-flagged platform. At each corner, it has four graceful octagonal turrets, which are capped by plastered kiosks with ribbed cupolas. The roof is covered by a false copped dome and crowned by a tall finial.
            The interior of the mausoleum is divided into nine chambers including the 19′-0″ square central sepulcher. This chamber is entirely veneered in white marble and there is a simple stepped cenotaph in its center.<br>
            Of the other eight chambers, the dados of the corner rooms were originally decorated with glazed tiles of various colors but these have now been covered with plaster. The remaining rooms are still paneled with marble. Curiously the roofs of all the nine chambers are spanned by overlapping courses of massive black basalt slabs on the principle of the corbel.
